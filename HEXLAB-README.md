# HexLab — Color converter

This small app lets you enter a hex color and see conversions to RGB, HSL and CMYK. It uses Tailwind for styling with a shadcn-inspired look.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes

- Tailwind is added to the project, but you must run `npm install` for it to be available.
- For full, official shadcn/ui components, follow the shadcn UI setup after installing dependencies — this project uses a shadcn-inspired look built with Tailwind.
